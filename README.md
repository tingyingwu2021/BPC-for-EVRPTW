# BPC-for-EVRPTW
C++ branch-price-and-cut(BPC) framework for electric vehicle routing problem with release time and due date(EVRPTW or EVRPRD), bounded bidirectional label setting algorithm, label correcting, pulse algorithm for solving the ESSPRC, SSPRC, NG-Route relaxation, DSSR relaxation are developed and coded in C++, several branching rules are used and compared. Rounded capacity inequality(RCI) and Sub-set row Cut(SRC) are used to improve the lower bound of the Restricted Master Problem(RMP)...
